Title: Visualization functions for spatial transcriptomics data
Description: Visualization functions for spatial transcriptomics data. Includes 
    functions to generate several types of plots, including spot plots, feature 
    (molecule) plots, reduced dimension plots, spot-level quality control (QC) 
    plots, and feature-level QC plots, for datasets from the 10x Genomics 
    Visium and other technological platforms. Datasets are assumed to be in 
    either SpatialExperiment or SingleCellExperiment format.
